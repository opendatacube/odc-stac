# ## Setup Instructions
#
# This notebook is meant to run on Planetary Computer lab hub.
#
# We need to install extra libraries first:
#
# ```bash
# pip install 'odc-stac>=0.2.1'
# ```
#
# This is enough to load data. But this notebook also uses some extra utilities
# from
#
# ```bash
# pip install odc-algo odc-ui
# ```
#

# %%
# #!pip install odc-stac>=0.2.1
# #!pip install odc-ui odc-algo

# ## Configuration
#
# For now we need to manually supply band `dtype` and `nodata` information for
# each band in the collection. Use band named `*` as a wildcard.

# Here we are looking for datasets in `sentinel-2-l2a` collection from June

# ## Lazy load all the bands
#
# We won't use all the bands but it doesn't matter as bands that we won't use
# won't be loaded. We are "loading" data with Dask, which means that at this
# point no reads will be happening just yet.
#
# If you were to skip `warnings: ignore` in the configuration, you'll see a
# warning about `rededge` common name being used on several bands. Basically we
# can only work with common names that uniquely identify some band. In this
# case EO extension defines common name `rededge` for bands 5, 6 and 7.

# In this case we request `red,green,blue,nir` bands which are common names for
# bands `B04,B03,B02,B08` and `SCL` band which is a canonical name.

# ## Generate some RGB images
#
# In this case we take `SCL` band and "colorize" it, simply replace every known
# category with an RGB pixel. Also we take RGB bands clamp pixel values into
# `[0,255]` range and form an RGBA image. Alpha band is set to transparent for
# those pixels that were `nodata` in the original `uint16` data for any of the
# channels.
#
# - Compute Alpha band using `.nodata` property
# - Clamp band `.red,.green,.blue` to `[1, 3000]`
# - Scale to `[0,255]`
# - Arrange it in a 4 channel image RGBA
#
# In our case bands were named "red,green,blue" and so `to_rgba(..)` know what
# band to use for what color, if you have native band names you can use
# `bands=` parameter to define which band is *red*, *green* and *blue*:
#
# ```
# to_rgba(..., bands=("B04","B03","B02"))

# ## Load all the data into Dask Cluster
#
# So far we have only constructed Dask graphs of computations we might want to
# perform. Now we use `client.persist(..)` to tell Dask to actually start data
# loading and processing and to keep results in the memory of the Dask cluster.
# We will then pull results into local process for display as we need it.

# %%
scl_rgb, im_rgba = client.persist([scl_rgb, im_rgba])
dask.distributed.progress([scl_rgb, im_rgba], multi=False)

# Can't merge with cell above as progress won't display then due to blocking
_ = dask.distributed.wait([scl_rgb, im_rgba])

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plot Imagery
#
# If all went well Dask have loaded all the data and transformed raw pixels
# into RGBA images. We can now visualise results using the same `xarray` plot
# tools we could use with local data. Behind the scenes Dask will transfer
# imagery from the cluster to the notebook as needed, since we used
# `.persist(..)` this operation should be quick. Preparing plots does take some
# time, but it's mostly the cost of interpolation for display as we need to
# resize ~10 megapixel images down to small size.
