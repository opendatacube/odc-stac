# Sample Notebooks


## Developer Notes

Do not commit `*.ipynb` files here! We use `jupytext` for keeping notebooks in
version control, specifically "py:percent" format. Install `jupytetxt` into your
jupyterlab environment, then you should be able to "Open With->Notebook" on
these `.py` files.

To create a new one, start with a notebook file (`.ipynb`) then use "Pair
Notebook with percent Script" command (type `Ctr-Shift-C` when editing notebook,
then start typing "percent" to fuzzy find the command)
